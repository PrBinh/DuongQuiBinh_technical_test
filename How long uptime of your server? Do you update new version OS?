The downtime as know the services stop and don't respone any request from client. 
In theory it would be great if the downtime would be zero, but it cann't. However, we can decrease it to minimum (less than 1%).
Actually, the uptime of my server is more than 98%.

I have usually update new version OS, because it was recommend.
