Both SSH key and password authentication have their pros and cons. Understand them to make the right choice for us company.

I have used password for SSH because i will set policy for password flexible and more secure.

I creating policies password such as:
      Setting a maximum number of attempts to access your account within a certain timeframe (e.g. 5 times within 15 minutes) before the account is locked
      Requiring a certain amount of capitalized letters, numbers, and symbols in the password
      Forcing users to reset their passwords periodically (e.g. every 90 days)
