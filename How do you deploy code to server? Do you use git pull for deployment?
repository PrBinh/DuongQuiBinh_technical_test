The first: create 2 branchs: master and dev
  master
  dev
dev branch is where to coder push code.
after coder push code, auto test pass -> deploy code to beta server (QA/tester will create UAT test)
if ok, i make merge to master branch.
on master branch, auto test code (by script tool), if ok enable deploy feature to production server.
review again and deploy it, QA/tester test again on production server.
if it error, i rollback to previous version in master branch.

if all done, using maven-plugin or another plugin to deploy artifact.


i used git pull to build code before deployment.
